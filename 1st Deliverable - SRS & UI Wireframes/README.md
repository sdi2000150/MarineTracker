# 1st Deliverable - SRS & UI Wireframes

## Overview
The 1st deliverable of the project includes the following:

- **SRS (Software Requirements Specification):**  
  The first version of the project design, which contains the analysis of requirements (the "what" will be implemented).  
  This document is available in the `srs.md` file. You can view it [here](./srs.md).

- **UI Wireframes:**  
  The first version of the front-end user interface, presented as prototypes.  
  The wireframes were created using **Figma** and are presented in the `ui.md` file. You can view it [here](./ui.md).  
  Additionally, the wireframe images themselves are stored in the `UI_Wireframes/` directory. You can view them [here](./UI_Wireframes/).
