# 2nd Deliverable - System Modeling & UML

## Overview
The 2nd deliverable of the project includes the following:

- **System Modeling & UML:**  
  A presentation that explains how the requirements from the SRS will be implemented.  
  The presentation also includes:
  - A UML diagram of our choice, modeling the structure of an interesting part of the system.
  - Some of the wireframes from the 1st deliverable.
  - Any changes made to the SRS document since the 1st deliverable.

  This presentation is available in the `System-Modeling-Presentation.pptx` file. You can view it [here](./System-Modeling-Presentation.pptx).

### Notes
From the 2nd deliverable onward, both the "what" (requirements) and the "how" (implementation) are finalized. The implementation will align with the descriptions provided in this deliverable.
